# Why we need?
- Component designs provide enough detail to to allow their transformation form design artifact into code easily. A more fine-grained level of design detail is required.
- Provide a form of design that closely resembles code so that complex operation can be  planned and evaluated prior to implementation in code.
- Provide the last form of design to create high-quality software operations that are correct, consistent and efficient.

# What is this?
- The idea of the detailed design phase is to manage complexity so that design artifacts can be translated to code with minimal effort. Even though, significant attempts can be made during the detailed design activity to create extensive design, is more practical applications  transitioning from the component design domain to code can still be daunting.
- Amount of effort spent during the design phase,  additional design efforts may be required during construction to identify, plan and manage the construction of complex operations. Extends the work performed during detailed design to provide essential information that is used to generate correct, efficient and consistent code.
- The lowest level of detailed design that address the modelling and specification of function implementations. By design complex operations, problem solutions can be evaluated, analysed and verified for correctness and efficiency before construction using programming languages.

# How does it work?
- Can address problem solving from a dynamic (behavioural) perspective, which provides the description of operation and the internal details and logic of each design entity. this approach involves graphical, tabular or method to model and specify the internal structure of function. so that algorithms or flows required to carry out a function intent are evaluated and clearly specified.
- The algorithm approach minimizes complexity during construction by providing a graphical method for specifying the details required by programmers to implement the function's code. A separate but closely related task performed when evaluating the quality of software construction deals with enforcing styles for establishing a consistent approach to structuring function implementations.
- These styles play a significant role  in shaping the system's maintainability, complexity and testability. Therefore , they are included as part of the construction design activity.

# Why study?
## Behaviour perspective
- Construction design is important because it provides the means for evaluating different implementations for a particular function before committing to it.
- Behavioural design at this level provide the means to evaluate a function 's completeness, complexity, testability and maintainability. They also provide the means for analysts to evaluate algorithms in regard to time-space performance and processing logic prior to implementation.
- Provide a representation of code through graphical and tabular ways, they increase collaborative evaluation efforts since Other members without knowledge of the particular programming language in use can evaluate the design and contribute to the solution..

>[!example] Collaboration effort during testing phases
>Construction designs can be used to generate unit test cases or the maintenance phase, where construction designs can be used to increase knowledge and understanding of the software behaviour.

## Structural perspective
- Construction design is important because it provides heuristics for establishing a common criterion for evaluating the quality of the structure of code, which directly affects code readability and thus maintenance.  Code with low readability leads to higher maintenance costs, since it requires more effort to understand.
- Construction styles are important during the design and construction phases perspective,, that code generation from design models can be done correctly.
## Construction perspective
- Construction styles serves as blueprint that ensures consistency among teams of developers. Finally, as mentioned before, during the testing and maintenance phase construction styles increase code readability and understanding, which can result in minimized cost during these phases.
