# Designer's Mental Model
- Allows designers to understand the complex interdependencies that exist among these different life cycle phases and how requirements and quality attributes are achieved throughout the software project.

- When presented with requirements or concerns from other stakeholders, detailed designers are able to visualize designs that provide the required structural and behavioural capabilities for achieving those needs. As they work to shape new or existing designs, they are also capable of visualizing the executing code to help them formalize the design.
- When given code such as the case during the maintenance phase, detailed designers are required to envision detailed designs or even reverse engineer the code into design and to understand how both code and designs relate to the original software requirements.
- When starting at detailed design, designers must be able to produce both code and architectural designs.
