- The design phase incorporates many activities and tasks conducted by different teams and typically managed by personnel other than designers. This requires a formal process to ensure that the design phase is conducted properly and that it addresses all the concerns identified for the software system being built.
- Many processes exist to carry out phases, activities and tasks throughout the software engineering life cycle:
  - Unified process (UP)
  - Scrum
  - Dynamic system development method (DSDM)
- In today's professional software engineering landscape, software engineers are being asked to build larger and more complex software systems in the same or different sites. Therefore, both design processes and artifacts are increasing in complexity. This means that it is not enough to know how to model structural and behavioural aspects of the system in the design, but it is also essential that software designers know about the particular process required to manage, create and control SD activities.

>[!note] Software Process definition by Sommerville
>A set of activities that lead to the production of a software product. Similarly, a SD process is a set of activities and controls that specify how resources work together for the production of SD artifacts

# SD Process
- The software engineering body of knowledge identifies 2 major activities for SD:
  - Software architecture
  - Detailed design

	These are the essential activities for managing the complexity involved in developing in developing large-scale software system. However, numerous other important activities required for supporting the creation of architectural and detailed designs. Therefore, when planning and identifying an appropriate SD process, the effort required for these activities needs to be considered.

- Emphasis that some forms of design place on construction, the detailed design activity process can be modified to explicitly present the construction design that addresses design issues encountered during the construction phase.
- The architectural design activities can begin during the analysis activity of the requirements phase and span through the design phase; in others, it begins after the requirements are specified and validated. In a similar fashion, the detailed design activity can start at the project's design phase and span through the software construction phase.

## Software Architecture
- Corresponds to a macro design approach for creating models that depict the quality and function of the software system. It provides black-box models used to evaluate the system's projected capabilities as well as its expected quality, all from multiple perspectives. Therefore, architectural designs allow different stakeholders, with different backgrounds and expertise to evaluate the design and ensure that the software architecture is addressing their concerns.
- From the configuration management perspective, architectural designs can provide information about the the hierarchy of files in the file system and how these files are interconnected to build and deploy the software system.
- From the software engineering perspective, different architectural designs can help decompose the software and define the major structural components of the system, identify interfaces between the components, map the requirement to them, evaluate concurrency issues and provide overall insight into design solution.

>Systems engineering perspective, architectural designs can provide information about the physical deployment of the system, including subsystems located at different locations, the artifacts executing in the subsystems and how the system as a whole communicates.

### Benefit of architecture design
- Capacity to evaluate high-level concerns from stakeholders that deal mostly with non-functional requirement.
- Serve as important communication reasoning and analysis tools that support the  systems.
- Lays the foundation for all subsequent work in the software engineering life cycle.

## Detailed Design
- Step begins after thee Software architecture is specified, reviewed and deemed sufficiently complete for detailed design to begin. Build on the software architecture to provide white-box design elements of the structure and behaviour of the software system and in many cases is the last major effort before software construction begins
