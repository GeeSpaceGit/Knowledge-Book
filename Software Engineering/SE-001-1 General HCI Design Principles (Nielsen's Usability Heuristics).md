# 10 Major Heuristic When Creating a User Interface
- Generic and open. This is intentional that be applied across a large cross section of software systems. This generality can sometimes lead to ambiguity and confusion on the part of the developer.
- Can be useful when developing software for specific platforms or system. The point is that there are some simple, straightforward things to consider when designing any  user interface.
- Focused on users and strive to keep them in control of system. Applying these rules in a specific application can help create an interface that users will find both useful and usable.
## 1. Visibility of system status
- Interface should have some mechanism for showing where users are in their task.

## 2. Match between system and the real world
- Interface should provide interaction that mimic or model what is expected in the real world.

## 3. User control and freedom
- Interface should support user exploitation without fear of breaking anything. Undo and Redo should be support.

## 4. Consistency and standard
- Interface should use language or wording that is consistent with users' expectation. Follow styles guides and platform standards 

## 5. Error prevention
- Interface should help users avoid mistakes. Always ask them when they initiate a destructive command.

## 6. Recognition rather than recall
- Interface should support rapid and easy learning of the system and support recognizing features.
- Their associated actions rather than relying on memorization of unique interface widget.

## 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Interface should provide users with shortcuts or other accelerators.
- Helps the interface get out of the way of expert users while allowing novice users the opportunity to become more efficient.
## 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Interface should present only the necessary information and no more. 
- Extra visual elements can distract from the important information.

## 9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from error
- Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem and constructively suggest a solution.

## 10. Help and documentation
- Make sure clearly available in the interface.
