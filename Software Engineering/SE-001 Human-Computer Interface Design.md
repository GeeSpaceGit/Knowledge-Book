Objective:
- Understand the role that the computer interface play in high-quality and successful software systems.
- Describe how to address interface design and evaluation within software  development life cycle.
- Provide usable guidance for evaluating designs.

# Why we need?
- To end user, the interface is the system. Most end users do not know nor do they even need to know, about the underlying structure and implementation of the software system. They are concerned only with the interface presented to them and the capabilities provided by that interface.
- The analogy of driving a car: the driver does not need to know anything about how an internal combustion engine works and how it is connected to the transmission to send power to the wheels, nor do they need to know about hydraulics and fluid dynamics of the braking system to actually drive a car. Indeed, mainly the driver  needs to know that "D" means drive, press gas pedal to go, press brake pedal to stop.^[Automatic transmission]
- End users are concerned only with what they can do the system and how they do it, not with how it works "under the hood." Hence it is of vital importance to get the interface design sufficiently correct so that it serves users in an efficient and usable manner.

# What?
- Human-computer interaction design must account for the user of the software. 
- While designing the architecture and detailed design of software systems is essential for meeting most quality attributes, design an efficient user interface that is understandable by the end user is paramount to the usability quality of all successful software system. The most elegant, efficient and high-quality architectural and detailed designs can be felled by a poor interface.

>Involves selecting appropriate information presentation and interaction techniques for the various end-user classes.

- This entails selecting appropriate information layouts, correct language, appropriate interface controls and trying the detailed design to the various input mechanisms provided in the interface.
- The implication is that there will be multiple interaction of a process that includes the following in 4 HCI design tasks:
	1. Creating a prototype of the system
	2. Having end users use that prototype in realistic ways.
	3. Gathering data from these tests.
	4. Redesigning the interface to address discovered problems.
- All of this work hinges on a through understanding of the users of the system. It is paramount to learn how the users typically perform similar actions and what their expectations of the new system may be.
# Why study?
- Visual designs have a major role in the success or failure of software systems. Systems that meet functional requirements but are not usable cannot succeed. Providing an interface that allow users to accomplish their goals with the software, without unnecessary effort, is the ultimate goal of the user interface designer.
- The major concern of the HCI designs may include the evaluation and use of modes, navigation, visual designs, response time and feedback and design modalities such as forms and menu-driven.
- Many design principles and evaluation techniques exist to successfully design user interfaces. Therefore, understanding the techniques and tools for designers to become proficient in creating efficient interfaces.

## Example

- The "without unnecessary effort" clause is important.
- The user interface could ask the user to type in the date in a text box. Without any extra information a user could type any of the following
