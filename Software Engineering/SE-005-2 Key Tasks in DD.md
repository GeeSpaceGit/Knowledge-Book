- Consider the case where formal design processes are followed so that the requirement phase is followed by the architectural design activity, which is followed so that the requirements phase is followed by the architectural design activity, which is followed by DD. Even defining the requirements is deferred to the detailed design phase, leaving the DD activity as the gatekeeper for ensuring that the system's specification and design are sufficiently complete before construction begin.
- Deferring such problems to the construction phase is a recipe for failure, since this typically results in higher cost. When done properly, DD should provide a ready-made solution that eases the construction process. 
- To achieve this during detailed design, designers must fully understand requirement assigned to components and architectural decisions deriving DD. They must design complex interfaces, identify design patterns, evaluate and validate DD, generate code from the models and establish policies for ensuring design synchronicity throughout the construction phase.
