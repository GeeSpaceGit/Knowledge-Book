# What is CD
- Provides a form of design that closely resembles code so that complex operations can be planned and evaluated prior to implementation in code. Once the correctness of operations is verified, the CD activity provides additional heuristics to enforce consistency in the code. Provides the last form of design to create high-quality software operations that are correct, consistent and efficient.
- Amount of effort spent during during the design phase, additional design phase, additional design efforts may stull be required during construction to identify, plan and manage the construction of complex operation. This form of CD extends the work performed during DD to provide essential information that is used to generate correct, efficient and consistent code.
- CD is the lowest level of DD that addresses the modelling and specification of function implementations. By designing complex operations, problem solutions can be evaluated, analysed and verified for correctness and efficiency before construction using programming languages.
## Address problem solving from a dynamic^[behavioral] perspective
- Which provides the description of operations and the internal details and logic of each design entity.
- This approach involves graphical, tabular or other methods to model and specify the internal structure of functions^[operation, routines] so that the algorithms or flows required to carry out a function's intent are evaluated and clearly specified.
- The algorithm approach minimizes complexity during construction by providing a graphical method for specifying the details required by programmers to implement the details required by programmers to implement the function's code.

## CD is not a new concept. 
- McConnell specifies 5 levels of SD, the lowest 2 which deal with division of data and routines within classes and internal routine design.
- Fox identifies a form of low-level design that fills the gap between detailed design and programming and deals with issues such as operation, including operation name, parameter types and return types.

# Why study CD
- Developing abstract models of the structure and behaviour of the internal implementation of operation.
## Behavioural Perspective
- Construction design is important because it provides the means for evaluating different implementations for particular function before committing to it.
- At this level provide the means to evaluate a function's completeness, complexity, testability and maintainability.
- Provide the means for analysts to evaluate algorithms in regard to time-space performance and processing logic prior to implementation.

## Structural Perspective
- Construction design is important because it provides heuristics for establishing a common criterion for evaluating the quality of the structure of code, which directly affects code readability and thus maintenance. Code with low readability leads to higher maintenance costs, since it requires more effort to understand.
- Construction styles are important during the design and construction phases so that code generation from design models can be done correctly.

## Construction Perspective
- Construction styles serve as a blueprint that ensures consistency among teams of developers.
- During testing and maintenance phase construction styles increase code readability and understanding, which can result in minimized cost during these phases.
