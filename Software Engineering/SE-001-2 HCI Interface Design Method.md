- To create an effective interface, the designer must rely on information from psychology, sociology, graphic design, human factors and ergonomics, computer science and mathematic.
- Each of the aforementioned areas contributes to the design of the interface in some specific way - whether it be in leveraging the intricacies of the human information's systems^[visual, audible, haptic] through colour choice, font choice, line width.
- For example, wording , ordering of information or icon design.

# Getting Started
- There is nonspecific structure required or followed; the designer simply starts thinking about ways to solve a problem and then drawing or writing out descriptions of that solution. Only technologies needed are kindergarten tools:  pencils, paper, crayons , markers, scissors and tape. Chalkboard or whiteboard and take pictures of the drawing for record keeping. In any case, the point is to capture ideas and thoughts on "paper" for later access.

>[!example] Humans like rectangle
> - Note that the majority of interfaces are rectangular. Most of the interfaces you will design will be contained in rectangle.
> - Rectangular calendars, Rectangle screens and rectangle books. 

>[!example] Words
>- North America, people read from left to right and from top to bottom.
>- Taught from early childhood when parents read to their children and trace their finger along with the words. They know to read, most children are trained to look at "readable" objects and materials at the top left and proceed to the right and down.

| Early design efforts generate low-fidelity prototypes of the system interface. Fidelity in this sense means the level of sophistication or realism in the interface.<br>        |                 | Required for summative evaluations. There is a spectrum of fidelity when it comes to designing prototype. |
| Drawing of an interface on paper, done in pencil, would require lots of imagination on the part of end users or clients if they were to get a feel for the intent of interface. |                 |                                                                                                           |
