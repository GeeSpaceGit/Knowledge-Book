# Introduction
- Before systems are deployed, significant efforts must be made to ensure that UI are sufficiently complete, understandable and efficient for providing users with systems that exhibit high quality in terms of usability. 
>[!note] Usability defined by IEEE
>The ease with which a user can learn to operate, prepare inputs for and interpret outputs of a system or component.

- Several approaches can be taken when evaluating and minimizing the degree of complexity involved when learning or using the system, including usability testing, analytic testing and empirical testing.
# Usability Testing
- Beneficial to understand testing and how to go about doing it. First, it should be noted that there are 2 classes of evaluation:
	- Formative Evaluation
	- Summative Evaluation
## Difference between Formative Evaluation and Summative Evaluation

| Formative Evaluation                                                            | Summative Evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Occurs within the design process and focuses on alternatives and clarification. | Occurs "after" the design process and process and focuses on assessing the result.<br>                                                                                                                  |
| Should be heavily                                                               | Should be utilized when a solid version of the interface is completed.^[This does not mean after the design is complete but rather when a version of the interface is considered ready for testing]<br> |
| Example: Cook tasting the soup.                                                 | Example: Customer tasting the soup                                                                                                                                                                      |

# Analytic Testing
- Involves domain or usability experts analyzing an interface for design issues.
- Often used earlier in the development process than empirical testing. That early in the interface design process there is usually no working system with which to test end users.
## Prototype
- Can be examined by knowledgeable experts for compliance with. For example, design guidelines, style guides and compatibility guides. These types of inspections have checklists or other guideline that are noted by evaluators. The end result is often a list of usability issues identified and sometimes rated by severity

## Analytic umbrella
- Usability inspections
  Simply experts using the prototype in intended ways while ensuring usability guideline are followed.

- Heuristic evaluations
  Involves multiple experts reviewing an interface with respect to a list of heuristics. Involves representative end users performing realistic tasks with the interface. [[SE-001-1 General HCI Design Principles (Nielsen's Usability Heuristics)]]
  
  Difference is that the evaluator may be a representative stakeholder. Result is a list of problems identified in the interface can be rated by severtity.
  
  Suffer a major weakness: The results are mainly the opinion of evaluator. Whether an identified issue will negatively impact real users of the system is unknown without further testing. This type of data is subjective and often holds less weight than objective data.

- Cognitive Walkthroughs
  An example of usability inspection. Experts are given a script to work through in an interface while looking for violations of usability guidelines and standards while assessing the interface for visual cues. A detailing of good and bad aspects of interfaces with respect to specific tasks.
# Empirical Testing (User Testing)
