- Corresponds to a macro design approach for transforming software requirements into design elements that support quality and functions of software systems.
- These design elements present system from different perspectives, thus providing stakeholders, with different background and expertise, the means to evaluate the appropriateness of architectural decisions for supporting the construction of the desired system.
- Places emphasis on system's quality and therefore provides the earliest means for ensuring that identified quality goals are evaluated and incorporated into the design before moving on to more detailed design and construction work. Lays the foundation for all subsequent work in the development process and serves as an important communication, reasoning and analysis tool for developing and maintaining software system.

# What is Software Architecture
- It helps to examine how other engineering disciplines employ architectural designs to build complex systems with demanding functional and quality requirements.
- Architects work to create the overall design elements appropriate for supporting efficient refinement and construction of software systems. 
- They must also address numerous quality properties^[performance, usability and maintainability] that combine together to produce software systems that meet the quality expected by their stakeholders.
## Form Structural, Logical Perspective
- Software architecture should address the needs of downstream designers and  developers by decomposing the software and defining the major components of the system, identifying their interfaces and interrelationships and providing support for both functional and quality attributes of the system.

## Configuration Management Perspective
- The architecture should provide information about the hierarchy of files in the file system, their interrelationships and the process for building one or more versions of the software system.

## System Engineering Perspective
- Architecture provides information about the physical deployment of the system, inkling the location of distributed subsystems, their interfaces and interrelationship and specification of communication protocols between them.

## Other Perspective
- Addressing various concerns that stakeholders may have and should be considered and designed for during the software architecture activity.
- The nature of stakeholders varies greatly in software systems, the perspective used to model the structure and behaviour of software systems varies as well.
- Collection of design elements and their detailed description help form the software architecture.
